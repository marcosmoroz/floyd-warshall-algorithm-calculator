SOME HISTORY:
The main reason to create this calculator was where I realized that there wasn't any floyd-warshall calculator on the Internet to check if my homework from the University was OK. So I decided to program an algorithm so that any person can check their floyd-warshall exercises and make it free and public so that whoever can use and modify as much as they desire. I'm an 21 software developer boy and I really love coding!

how to implement "floyd-warshall-algorith-calculator" in my website?
1) clone this repository or download the .zip
2) extract the .zip downloaded
3) copy the folder "floyd-warshall-algorith-calculator-main" (if you want, you can change the name)
4) paste the folder inside your web root folder server (e.g: apache uses "htdocs" folder in Windows systems or "/var/www/html" path in Linux systems)
5) enjoy it!

If you find a bug or you want to improve this algorithm, just send your PR!
pd: just remember using this format for your commit: (e.g: "MM: this is my commit: date") -> MM = the first letter of my name and surname

Thx for reading! :)
